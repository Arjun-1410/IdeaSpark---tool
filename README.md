# IdeaSpark - Your Dynamic Brainstorming Partner

IdeaSpark is a Python Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to help you brainstorm and generate structured ideas for any concept. It acts as your personal AI strategist, breaking down vague concepts into actionable angles like target users, business models, technologies, and ethical considerations.

## Features

-   **Structured Brainstorming:** Generates 5 distinct angles (Target Users, Core Problem, Business Models, Key Technologies, Ethical Considerations) for any concept.
-   **LLM-Powered:** Utilizes powerful LLM APIs (e.g., Google Gemini) for intelligent idea generation.
-   **CLI Interface:** Easy to use directly from your terminal.
-   **Secure API Key Handling:** Loads API key from environment variables, never hardcoding sensitive information.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Arjun-1410/IdeaSpark---tool.git](https://github.com/Arjun-1410/IdeaSpark---tool.git)
    cd IdeaSpark---tool
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `Arjun-1410` with your actual GitHub username if it's different.)*

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    * Obtain a Google Gemini API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    * **Crucially, set it as a permanent environment variable named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`** on your system. This is vital for security.
        * **Windows (Administrator Command Prompt):**
            ```cmd
            setx GOOGLE_API_KEY "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
            ```
        * **Linux/macOS (add to your shell's config file, e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):**
            ```bash
            export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
            ```
        * **Remember to close and reopen your terminal after using `setx` or modifying your shell config file for the variable to take effect!**

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Linux/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows (Command Prompt):
    .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # On Windows (PowerShell):
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

5.  **Run the tool:**
    ```bash
    python ideaspark.py
    ```
    Follow the prompts to enter your concept.
